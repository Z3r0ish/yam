# Yet Another (package) Manager

I was challenged to make my own package manager so here it is

Btw edit yam.conf so the script will work, also only one package will download rn (yay-example-package) but it won't install also updates are kinda working right now

```
-S <package> Downloads the selected package 
-U <package> Updates the selected package to the lastest version
-Q <package> Querys the sources list for a package
-F Updates the sources list
-C Prints out the config file
-h Brings up this list
```
