# Yet Another (package) Manager

I was challenged to make my own package manager so here it is

Btw edit yam.conf so the script will work, also only one package will download rn (instaPoster) but it won't install also updates(U and F options) don't work right now

```
-S <package> Downloads the selected package 
-U <package> Updates the selected package to the lastest version
-Q <package> Querys the sources list for a package
-F Updates the sources list
-C Prints out the config file
-h Brings up this list
```
